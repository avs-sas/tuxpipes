A list of changes and features planed for the project in no particular order.

    the risk of missing files etc.
- bash script tutorial to walk you through the different commands with examples
    Better understanding than reading some dictionaries
- Remove unnecessary prints/outputs
- Change the way the program looks for pipes.json and settings.json
